                <p>
                    I failed again. The list-the mental list- the end-all-be-all, of everything I should have accomplished that hot summer day, was barely dented. Shattered. Brocken. Failure. …Again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was my mindset, day in and day out when I was 16 years old. I started each day with a long list of to-dos (unrealistic to say the least), absolutely positive that if I could just discipline myself enough, I’d get it all done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each night, I shook in tears knowing that I was a failure, because I couldn’t live up to my own expectations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perfectionism. Toxic perfectionism. -That’s what I suffered from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to MasterClass, “Toxic perfectionism is perfectionism with no accompanying sense of realism. …They cease to see perfection as a direction in which to head and begin to think it’s a goal someone can actually achieve.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was my case. I suffered from a belief that I could achieve my unrealistic expectations. My to-do list exceeded my abilities. In my head, it was realistic. -Yet I failed because I was the problem, not the list. Unfortunately, this mentality is common.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a society so set on meeting unrealistic expectations, we think that if we can just push ourselves a little harder, then we’ll force ourselves to achieve. Wrong. Kicking a wounded animal never did any good, so why would it work with us? Perfectionism affects teenagers, parents, grandparents, and everyone in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Countless moms especially struggle under the pressure of perfectionism. They struggle to go to school or work, while also keeping the house clean, the children cared for, let alone finding an inch of time for sanity. -Plenty of men feel the same way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are constantly in subconscious battles to measure up to the ideal – (ignore the fact that these ideals are completely unrealistic.) -Yet how do we get to this point? Where does this perfectionism stem from?
                </p>

                <h5>
                    The Roots of Perfectionism
                </h5>
                <p>
                    It starts with people we care about. Many moms give everything for their children, their internal desires to succeed as a mother are strong. Yet subconsciously, that motivation is often driven by fear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to Psychology Today, “What makes extreme perfectionism so toxic is that while those in its grip desire success, they are most focused on avoiding failure, resulting in a negative orientation.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fear of failure drives this action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With such fear, mothers stress over what the house should look like, what church engagement should look like, what community service should look like, and what their children should look like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice a pattern? Toxic perfectionism is hyper fixated on looks and outward validation. When looks, rules, and expectations become more important than the people we love, including ourselves, a perspective shift is due.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sadly, perfectionism starts subtly, and has stark consequences.
                </p>

                <h5>
                    Effects of Perfectionism
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Psychology Today has shown that studies found links between Toxic Perfectionism and the following: black and white thinking, lack of creativity, procrastination, and toxic comparisons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studies have also shown that it often comes with depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and suicidal impulses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These consequences have been seen in adults and their children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to a study of over 300 children, 27.6% were in the high-perfectionism group (Sylvia Melero et al.). An additional study in 2015 showed a causal relationship between mothers’ perfectionism and emotional struggles in their daughters, including depression and anxiety (Sona Samiei Sarkhanlou et al.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clearly change is needed. But we come to a crossroads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, you may be thinking, ‘that sounds nice and good for other people, but it’s not me’. Before you skim to the bottom consider the following questions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        How often do I say “should/need to/have to?”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How do I respond when I make mistakes in work, school, or at home?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What messages am I sending my brain by the way I talk about myself? Do I insult myself, (jokingly or otherwise?)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do I place my worth in others’ opinions, the way I look, or in my projects?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If, after considering these questions, you see room for improvement, a shift in perspective can prove useful. So how do we change something so subtly layered?
                </p>

                <h5>
                    Shifting the Perspective
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The answer is baby-steps. Perfectionism thrives in absolutes, “either I exercise for an hour, or not at all.” “Either the party is flawless, or it’s a failure.” These absolutes thwart progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s where baby steps come in.  Rather than all-or-nothing, baby steps celebrate effort. What baby steps will you take to shift your mentality?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some ideas include:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span className='bold'>Shifting words</span>: Any time you notice yourself saying “should/need/have to” shift the language to be more gentle: “I can/I will/It would be wise to.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span className='bold'>Celebrate success</span>: Each time you recognize a small victory (even if it was only part of what you wanted to achieve) congratulate yourself!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span className='bold'>Affirmations</span>: “Even though I didn’t _______, I accept my effort”
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span className='bold'>Set small goals</span>: Take one of your expectations and break it into smaller pieces. Even if it’s just part of what you want to achieve, you’ll find that you can eat an elephant one bite at a time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span className='bold'>Talk with a professional</span>: In certain cases, it’s wise to seek professional advice, to shift perfectionistic perspectives over time. Know that it’s okay to seek professional help, and that in time, you will heal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, there are still people reading this who are thinking “oh this would really help someone I know.” But can it help you too? The reality is, the perfectionism pandemic is still spreading, despite our growing knowledge of it. A major part of that is thinking this applies to others, rather than to ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To some degree, you may struggle with perfectionist tendencies. It’s a continuum. There’s no hard line to it. Wherever you are on the scale, you can improve the messages you send to yourself. We all can. So, before you write this one off as “for somebody else,” review the list above one last time. Is there something you can work on to improve your self-acceptance? If you work on one today, you’ll be more ahead tomorrow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Give yourself grace by doing this today and improve your self-acceptance. You’ll find that you are worth it.
                </p>
