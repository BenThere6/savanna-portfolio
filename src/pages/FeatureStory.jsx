                <p>
                    Dirty Dough responded to being sued with strategic PR methods that doubled their sales.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only one store open and the new cookie company was being sued. At that point, it could barely be called a franchise. -The cookie company, Dirty Dough, had sold 60 franchises, but none were open. Their original store stood alone, and now they were being sued. For Bennett Maxwell, Dirty Dough’s founder, this was a jaw-drop moment. What on EARTH was he being sued for?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turns out, it was all in the sprinkles. Crumbl Cookie, a Colossus in the cookie world, was suing them for “copying” their cookie tactics of:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sprinkles</li>
                    <li>Box style</li>
                    <li>A weekly rotating menu</li>
                    <li>...And for exploiting Crumbl’s trade secrets.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Despite the odds, Dirty Dough’s revenue skyrocketed with the lawsuit. Just 6 months after it began, Dirty Dough sold over 100 franchises. At $40,000 per franchise, that’s $4 million in revenue.
                </p>
                <p>How did Dirty Dough take a lawsuit, and use it to double franchise numbers? Here’s how:</p>
                <h5>Faced it head on</h5>
                <p>
                    When the first news article about the lawsuit came out, Dirty Dough decided to do more than sit back and take it. They released a series of ads targeting Crumbl and the lawsuit. Their billboards had slogans like “Cookies so good we’re being sued!” and “We don’t file lawsuits, we just have the better cookie.” Dirty Dough also created #utahcookiewars to mark their battle with Crumbl on every ad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These billboards ran from Davis to Utah County. Although the billboards spread the word, Maxwell said that his LinkedIn post – a picture of one of the ads- got way more attention. After that post, the story was picked up by Good Morning America and CNBC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These ads aren’t the only reason Dirty Dough won the PR battle.
                </p>
                <h5>PR Perspective</h5>
                <p>
                    While a lawsuit isn’t exactly a cookie maker’s dream, Dirty Dough kept a PR perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Maxwell put it “throughout the whole lawsuit I viewed the legal expenses as PR expenses.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    When an $80,000 bill came in, Maxwell would remind himself that he was making more off the lawsuit than he was paying for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He said, “that really was better marketing/PR than I could’ve ever dreamed of.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to CNBC, Dirty Dough’s sales doubled during the lawsuit. Yet Maxwell said the big success was really the franchise sales doubling. At $40,000 in revenue per sale, Maxwell’s efforts to shape the narrative clearly paid off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another factor in this scenario was the fast reputation that Dirty Dough Received. The public, in Maxwell’s opinion, had built a narrative around the lawsuit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As he put it, they were thinking: “oh two big cookie companies in a legal battle!” But in reality, Maxwell said “No, we have one franchise open. And they have 400.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the contrast, The public was sure two worthy foes were in open battle. This was natural publicity, but Maxwell’s clever ads and strategic messaging took Dirty Dough’s PR a step further.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PR professionals can learn from Maxwell’s drive to take a disaster and create an opportunity. He accomplished this by his PR perspective, purposeful planning, and by embracing the limelight.
                </p>
                <h5>Embraced the Limelight</h5>
                <p>
                    While his original intention was not to attack his attacker, Maxwell said that after the initial KSL article, it was time to be clear about his side of the story. He embraced the limelight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Crumble denied every interview” Maxwell said. “I took every single news interview; they took zero. There was only one side of the story.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    By being open with the media during a high-stakes lawsuit Maxwell gained the media’s trust, in sharp contrast with Crumbl who accepted no interviews at the time. The way Maxwell put it, they had no response to questions like “Are you really suing somebody over sprinkles?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maxwell raised public awareness and trust of his company, by being open about the lawsuit. In this, he stands as a great example to PR representatives of shaping the narrative and being open through a crisis.
                </p>
                <h5>Personality</h5>
                <p>
                    Finally, Maxwell brandished his company’s personality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the Ads, Dirty Dough released satirical clips that poked fun at Crumbl for suing a 4-year-old company over sprinkles. The videos debuted obnoxious villains who had it out for Dirty Dough and tried to create a lawsuit out of nothing. Comedy-filled with a flair of snark, the videos were designed to laugh at the whole situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a clear reflection of Maxwell’s perspective:
                </p>
                <p>
                    He said he wanted the videos to “address the lawsuit head-on. ...The advice I got elsewhere was ‘no no no, you can’t talk about that, cause that’s in the lawsuit’ and I’m like ‘no no no, that’s the only thing that the videos are gonna be about. It’s gonna pick apart each part of the lawsuit.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    While others fearfully warned Maxwell not to poke the bear because Crumbl had more money, Maxwell had a different mindset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Unless there’s the mob and I have to …fear for my life” Maxwell said, “I think they’re already doing everything they can to hurt me, so I leaned into it. …I just have that personality of ‘it’s gonna be hard, make fun of it, be lighthearted and be open.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Dirty Dough, letting genuine personality show brought genuine results.
                </p>
                <h5>The Results</h5>
                <p>
                    Intending to crush its competitor, Crumbl put Dirty Dough on the map. This is a result of Dirty Dough’s consistent PR response. Stakes were high, and they faced the crisis head on by creating ads, releasing videos, and accepting interviews with humor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the lawsuit went public, it didn’t take long for Dirty Dough to see results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ”By the end of the year” said Maxwell, “I think we were at like 290 or maybe 250 [franchises], but I know we were in the 200’s of franchises, so we sold over 100 in less than six months.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    That wasn’t just luck. That was the result of creative thinking, genuineness, and strategic planning at its finest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PR professionals can learn from this to keep a clear head, be transparent, and look for creative opportunities to shape the narrative during a crisis.
