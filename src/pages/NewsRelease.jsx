                <h2 id='lie-title'>News Release: Freeman Hrabowski speaks at BYU</h2>
                <p>
                    PROVO, Utah — BYU students will get to hear from a man who was imprisoned at age 12 for his part in MLK Jr.’s march for civil rights. President Emeritus of the UMBC, Hrabowski is speaking at BYU on February 27.

                    When he was a child, Hrabowski’s neighborhood friend was killed by the KKK bombing a Birmingham Baptist church in 1963. Later, at age 12, he joined Martin Luther King Jr’s Children’s Crusade and was arrested in the mass-arrest. These experiences shaped Hrabowski’s life, and he has made himself a voice for the minorities in education. His philosophy is to take a stand.

                    “Speak up. You have to project! If people can't hear you, it doesn't matter what you say” Hrabowski said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hrabowski’s life is a testament to these words. Although he grew up in segregated Alabama, Hrabowski didn’t let segregation stop him from pursuing his own education. At age 16, Hrabowski graduated from high school, then studied at the Hampton Institute. He earned his bachelor’s in mathematics at age 20 and went on to receive his Ph.D. Years later, Hrabowski became President of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

                    While there, he focused on being involved with his students and teaching them to be successful in the pursuit of education.

                <p>
                    “What people don't realize is that everybody needs support, one way or another” Hrabowski said. His rigor in pursuing an education is a testament to that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hrabowski has continued to focus his efforts on helping others succeed in the academic world, especially minority groups. His TedTalk “Four Pillars of College Success in Science” was no exception.

                    Hrabowski has been called one of the most influential people in America for his work in minority participation and student success in college. As such, he co-created the Meyerhoff Scholars Program, which encourages diversity in future leaders in STEM. He has also participated in numerous organizations, including the Baltimore Community Foundation and the American Association of Colleges and Universities.

                    In 2012, President Obama named Hrabowski to chair the President’s Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for African Americans.

                    Hrabowski’s efforts have been recognized worldwide, and he spoke at Harvard as the Inaugural Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Commemorative Lecture Speaker.

                    Hrabowski’s message is that people can pursue education and foster faith simultaneously. This, he exemplified.
